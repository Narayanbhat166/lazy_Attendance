# A few thoughts

This is a telegram bot server running **locally** and connected to the external world with the help of **ngrok**. There are a few utility functions that aid in serving the process

# So what it does?

just upload a screen recorded video, and it will give you the excel sheet with the students name, cool!The client is telegram

Don't worry if your friends are sending the video simultaneously, the bot can handle them and serve the next request. And there are locks also
